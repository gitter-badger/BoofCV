# Introduction
------------------------------------

BoofCV is an open source computer vision library written entirely in Java by Peter Abeles.  It is released under the Apache License 2.0.  Source code, examples, and other utilties are included in this package.  This document contains only a brief summary of the directory structure and how to build the source code.  For more detailed and update information please visible the web pages below.

## Where to Download

You can download complete jars, use Maven, or checkout from Github.  See the website for instructions.

http://boofcv.org/index.php?title=Download:BoofCV

## Include in Gradle and Maven Projects

BoofCV is divided up into many modules.  The easiest way to include all of them is to make your project dependent on 'main:all'

For Gradle projects:
```groovy
compile group: 'org.boofcv', name: 'all', version: '0.20'
```

For Maven projects:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.boofcv</groupId>
  <artifactId>all</artifactId>
  <version>0.20</version>
</dependency>
```

There are also several integration modules which help BoofCV interact with external projects.  A list of those is included below:

          Name            |                 Description
--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
integration:android       | Useful functions for working inside of Android devices.
integration:applet        | Code for using BoofCV inside a Java applet.
integration:jcodec        | [JCodec](http://jcodec.org/) is a pure Java video reader/writer.
integration:openkinect    | Used the [Kinect](http://openkinect.org) RGB-D sensor with BoofCV.
integration:WebcamCapture | A few functions that make [WebcamCapture](http://webcam-capture.sarxos.pl/) even easier to use.
integration:xuggler       | [Xuggler](http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/) is a wrapper around FFMPEG for reading video files.


## New to Java?

If you are new to Java, then using BoofCV will be a challenge.  With just a little bit of knowledge it is possible to build and run examples using the instructions below.  Integrating BoofCV into your own project is another issue.  If you don't know what a jar file is or how to import classes, it is highly recommend that you learn the basics first before attempting to use BoofCV.

## Directories

Directory       | Description
----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
applications/   | Helpful applications
data/           | Directory containing optional data used by applets and examples.
demonstrations/ | Demonstration code which typically lets experiment by changing parameters in real-time
examples/       | Set of example code designed to be easy to read and understand.
integration/    | Contains code which allows BoofCV to be easily integrated with 3rd party libraries.  Primary for video input/output.
main/           | Contains the source code for BoofCV

# Building from Source
------------------------------------

BoofCV is a java library and can be compiled on any platform with Java installed. Gradle is now the preferred way to build BoofCV.  There are still Ant build scripts laying around but those will be removed in the near future and their use is not officially supported any more.

BEFORE trying to compile BoofCV make sure you have the following installed and that the paths are setup correctly:

- [ Java Developers Kit (JDK) version 1.6 or later    ]
  ( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html )
- [ Gradle                                            ]
  ( http://www.gradle.org/                            )

BoofCV is very easy to build on just about any system with Gradle and Java support.  Gradle will download all of the dependencies for you.  Well that's not totally true, there are a couple of optional packages which require manual downloading since they lack jars on Maven central. More on that later.

*NOTE* As an alternative to installing Gradle directly there are shell scripts "boofcv/gradlew" and "boofcv/gradlew.bat".  They will download gradle and execute the commands the same as invoking "gradle" would.

Below are a few useful custom Gradle scripts that can be invoked:

* _oneJarBin_ : Creates a single jar that contains all of BoofCV main and integration
* _createLibraryDirectory_ : Will gather all the BoofCV jars (main and integration) and jars that BoofCV depends on and place them in the "boofcv/library" directory.
* _alljavadoc_ : Combines JavaDoc from all the sub-projects into one set.

_createLibraryDirectory_ unless all dependencies are meet, not all projects in 'boofcv/integration' will produce jars.  See the "Integration Modules" section below for the details.

## Compilation Error

A stable build should always compile out of the box with no problem.  All of the examples should run without any problems, as long as you don't modify anything, even slightly.  Before you complain about a problem on a stable build make sure you are absolutely certain that you're doing everything right.  If after a few 
attempts you still can't figure out post a message.  Maybe these instructions are lacking in clarity.

If you checked out the code from Github then you don't have a stable build and like to live dangerously.  There is a chance the code won't compile or one of the libraries it depends on has changed.  If you get a compilation error feel free to post a polite message with a copy of the error asking for someone to fix it.

## IntelliJ

You will need to import the Gradle project into IntelliJ.  Verified to work in IntelliJ IDEA 13.1.x.

### Install IntelliJ Gradle Plug-In
1. File -> Settings -> Plugins
2. Search for Gradle. Install if it isn't already

### Opening the Project
1. File->Import Project
2. Select boofcv/build.gradle

## Eclipse

Eclipse has a Gradle plugin available which allow it to open a Gradle project directly.  The following was
 tested with Kepler.

### Install Eclipse Gradle Plug-In
1. Help -> Eclipse Marketplace
2. Search for "Gradle IDE Pack" and install
3. Restart Eclipse

### Configure Gradle
1. Window -> Preference -> Gradle EnIDE
2. Specify Gradle Home.  On my system this is /opt/gradle/gradle-1.12
3. Click OK

### Opening the Project
1. File -> Import -> SelectGradle
2. Click "Browse" button and browse to boofcv/ directory
3. Click "Build Model" button
4. Click "Select All" to import all sub-projects 
5. Click finish

## Integration Modules

Most of the modules in the integration package should automatically with everything else.  Some require you to manually download and place files in certain locations.  Until you do so Gradle will ignore those modules.
Specific instructions are contained in the readme file in each of the module directories.

# Running Example and Demonstration Code
-----------------------------------------

The example code can be easily run from your favorite IDE.  You might need to change the workspace directory so that
it can find the boofcv/data directory.

Examples can also be run using gradle.

* _exampleRun_ : Runs an example from boofcv/examples
  * gradle exampleRun -Pwhich=boofcv.examples.imageprocessing.ExampleBinaryOps
* _webcamRun_ : Run an example from boofcv/integration/WebcamCapture
  * gradle webcamRun -Pwhich=boofcv.examples.ExampleTrackingKlt
* _demonstrationRun_ : Runs a demonstration from boofcv/demonstrations
  * gradle demonstrationRun -Pwhich=boofcv.demonstrations.fiducial.FiducialTrackerApp


# Dependencies
-----------------------------------------

The main BoofCV modules depends on the following libraries

- [ EJML          ]  ( http://code.google.com/p/efficient-java-matrix-library )
- [ GeoRegression ]  ( http://georegression.org                               )

- [ JUnit   ]       ( http://junit.sourceforge.net/                           )

Code from the following libraries has been integrated into BoofCV

- [General Purpose FFT by Takuya Ooura] (http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ooura/fft.html)
  * Java port by Piotr Wendykier with modifications by Peter Abeles to recycle memory.
  
The optional sub-projects in integration also have several dependencies. See those sub-projects for a list of their dependencies.
